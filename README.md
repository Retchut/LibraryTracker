# LibraryTracker
Work in progress. 

Simple program to track a card library, or a library of any type.

With time, I intend to integrate a web crawler, in order to look up prices in cardmarket.eu, so as to update a small local database of prices pertaining to cards in the library.

Implemented features:
	- Adding/Removing cards to/from a library
	- Listing cards in a library
	- Saving and loading a library

WIP:
	- Web crawling shenanigans
